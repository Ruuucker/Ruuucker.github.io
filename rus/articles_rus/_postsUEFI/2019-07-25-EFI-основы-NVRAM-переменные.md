# NVRAM Variables Explained

NVRAM is non-volatile RAM that is used in EFI to store variables that need to persist between boots. Many of these NVRAM variables are architecturally defined, and setting invalid options to NVRAM could cause a machine to not be able to boot.

During the startup process, multiple drivers and applications can rely on NVRAM values to help them do their jobs. Below is a diagram from the UEFI 2.56 specification that shows this happening.

Because the bootloader and other drivers are configured to load information from NVRAM, if we can write to some of these NVRAM variables, we will have control over parts of how the system boots.

NVRAM variables are a combination of a GUID of the variable owner, a name, and a value. An example of a few of these values, as displayed by the UEFI shell command dmpstore, is below:

  # Important NVRAM Variables and GUIDs.
  
Below are some important NVRAM variables to be aware of. There is technically no guarantee that these variables will be present on any machine, they are either defined by the specification or known to be used by specific vendors.

This list is not comprehensive: items will be added/taken away as things change or we discover new things that we care about.

~~~
GUID 	Variable Name 	

General Description
8BE4DF61-93CA-11D2-AA0D-00E098032B8C (Efi) 	BootOrder 	

An in-order array of 16-bit integers that refer to boot options. The system will

attempt to boot from each of the Boot#### devices in the order that they are

listed in this variable. Once a boot option is successfully loaded, the system

does not continue to try to load any subsequent boot options.
8BE4DF61-93CA-11D2-AA0D-00E098032B8C (Efi) 	Boot#### 	

One particular device that can be booted. #### is a four-digit hex number.

This variable is of the type EFI_LOAD_OPTION, found in section 3.1.3 of the

UEFI 2.5 spec.
8BE4DF61-93CA-11D2-AA0D-00E098032B8C (Efi) 	DriverOrder 	

An in-order array of 16-bit integers of drivers to be loaded. Similar to BootOrder,

this variable lists the drivers that are to be loaded on boot in order. However,

unlike BootOrder, all drivers will be loaded, not just the first successful driver.
 8BE4DF61-93CA-11D2-AA0D-00E098032B8C (Efi) 	Driver#### 	

A driver that is to be loaded on boot, if selected in DriverOrder.

#### is a four-digit hex number. This variable is of the type EFI_LOAD_OPTION,

found in section 3.1.3 of the UEFI 2.5 spec.
4D1ED05-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B38C14 	EnableDriverOrder 	

Apple specific, causes loader to use the DriverOrder and Driver#### variables.

Consumed after use. Uses DriverOrder if EnableDriverOrder==0x31
7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 	csr-active-config 	

Apple specific, configuration for El Capitan's SIP.

A value of 0x10 means that it is enabled, 0x77 means that it is completely disabled.

# Setting NVRAM Variables from OS X

It is possible to set (some) variables from the OS X Terminal if you have root. The command to use is nvram, whose manpage output is below.

~~~
nvram(8)                                                              nvram(8)
NAME
       nvram - manipulate firmware NVRAM variables
SYNOPSIS
       nvram  [ -p ] [ -f filename ] [ -d name ] [ -c ] [ name [= value ]] ...
DESCRIPTION
       The nvram command allows manipulation of firmware NVRAM variables.   It
       can be used to get or set a variable.  It can also be used to print all
       of the variables or set a list of variables from a  file.   Changes  to
       NVRAM variables are only saved by clean restart or shutdown.
       In  principle,  name  can  be any string.  In practice, not all strings
       will be accepted.  New World  machines  can  create  new  variables  as
       desired.  Some variables require administrator privilege to get or set.
       The given value must match the data type  required  for  name.   Binary
       data  can  be  set using the %xx notation, where xx is the hex value of
       the byte.  The type for new variables is always binary data.
OPTIONS
       -d name
              Deletes the named firmware variable.
       -f filename
              Set firmware variables from a text file.  The  file  must  be  a
              list  of  "name value" statements.  The first space on each line
              is taken to be the separator between "name" and "value".  If the
              last  character  of  a  line is \, the value extends to the next
              line.
       -x     Use XML format for reading and writing variables.   This  option
              must  be  used  before the -p or -f options, since arguments are
              processed in order.
       -c     Delete all of the firmware variables.
       -p     Print all of the firmware variables.
EXAMPLES
              example% nvram boot-args="-s rd=*hd:10"
       Set the boot-args variable to "-s rd=*hd:10".  This would specify  sin-
       gle user mode with the root device in hard drive partition 10.

              example% nvram my-variable="String One%00String Two%00%00"
       Create  a new variable, my-variable, containing a list of two C-strings
       that is terminated by a NUL.

              example% nvram -d my-variable
       Deletes the variable named my-variable.
                               October 28, 2003                       nvram(8)
~~~

However, the manpage does not tell you everything you need to know about nvram. Although nvram -p claims to print all of the firmware variables, it does not print any of the variables that belong to the Efi GUID.

Similarly, by default, any NVRAM variable that you set from this tool will have the Apple GUID used by csr-active-config (in the table in the previous section.) However, if you are trying to set values like DriverOrder, they need to have the correct GUID, or they will not be processed by EFI like you want.

Fortunately, you actually can set variables such as DriverOrder using the nvram as long as you specify the GUID. An example of this, which sets Driver order to load Driver5000 (endian-ness is important) and another command to set EnableDriverOrder are below:

~~~
$ sudo nvram 8BE4DF61-93CA-11D2-AA0D-00E098032B8C:DriverOrder=%00%50
$ sudo nvram 4D1ED05-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B38C14:EnableDriverOrder=1
~~~

# Issues Created by SIP (rootless) in OS X 10.11

With the introduction of System Integrity Protection in OS X 10.11 (El Capitan), Apple has locked down some of the things you can do with the nvram command.

Specifically, you can no longer set any variables that belong to the Efi GUID, like BootOrder. Similarly, you are not allowed to change the NVRAM variable that stores the SIP configuration, csr-active-config.

However, at least as of 10.11.0 (10/2/2015), you can still set the EnableDriverOrder variable.

# Setting NVRAM Variables from an EFI Application/Driver

If you are running from within an EFI context, you can set NVRAM variables directly. Found on page 241 of the UEFI 2.5 spec, the command to set an NVRAM variable is as follows:

~~~
EFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES->SetVariable(
CHAR16* VariableName,
EFI_GUID *VendorGuid,
UINT32 Attributes,
UINTN DataSize,
VOID *Data
);
~~~

The VendorGuid field can be set manually (by naming a GUID in your header file, or something along those lines) or by using some of the GUIDs built into the EDK.

For either Windows or Linux, the EFI GUID (used for BootOrder. Driver####, etc) has been included as part of MdePkg, the main build package. As long as your .inf file includes MdePkg/MdePkg.dec (under the [Packages] field), you can reference it as shown below:

~~~
#include  <Guid/GlobalVariable.h>
...
[other code]
...
Status = gRT->SetVariable(
BOOT_ORDER_NAME,
&gEfiGlobalVariableGuid,	//This is where the GUID is referenced, name defined in GlobalVariable.h from MdePkg.
EFI_VARIABLE_NON_VOLATILE | EFI_VARIABLE_BOOTSERVICE_ACCESS | EFI_VARIABLE_RUNTIME_ACCESS,
BOOT_ORDER_LEN,
&BOOT_ORDER_DATA
);
~~~

If you would like other examples of how this is done in practice, you can find them in DarkMallet (stash link, see mallet.c and mallet.h) or in the QuarkMatter proof-of-concept DriverOrder program (stash link).
